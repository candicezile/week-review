# week-review-1


I completed the interactive git visualization tool that Warrick gave us, it was helpful a lot. I attended two English classes, attended a workshop with Nic and Warrick and I had a session with Jason. I got started with terminal command lines. I also completed one assignment in English and I finished reading the English article that Taz sent me.
